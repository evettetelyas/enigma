# Enigma

### self eval
- Functionality: 4 => 
  iterations 1-4 work as expected

- OOP: 3.9 => 
Enigma was complete with the required 4 classes. I utilized class methods, inheritance, modules, and the entire project is complete in 87 LOC. While there is 1 vital method in the cracking module that does reach 10 LOC, the length of this method is necessary to account for the four possible shift types used to crack encryptions.

- Testing: 3.5 =>
testing is complete at 100% coverage. Did not use mocks or stubs.

- Version Control: 3.5 =>
I definitely commited multiple ideas at the same time, but my pulls and commits are high. I also still have a hate/hate relationship with Github, but we're working on it.
