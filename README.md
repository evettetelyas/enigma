# Enigma

### self eval
- functionality: 4 => 
  iterations 1-4 work as expected

- OOP: 3.9 => 
Enigma was complete with the required 4 classes. I utilized class methods, inheritance, modules, and the entire project is complete in 118 LOC. Also, humble brag, iterations 1-3 are done in 49 LOC. While there are 4 vital methods in the cracking module that reach 10 LOC, the length of these methods is necessary to account for the four possible shifts used to crack encryptions.

- Testing: 3.5 =>
testing is complete at 100% coverage. I still do not really see the point of using Mocks or Stubs in a finished project.

- Version Control: 3.5 =>
I definitely commited multiple ideas at the same time, but my pulls and commits are high. I also still have a hate/hate relationship with Github.
